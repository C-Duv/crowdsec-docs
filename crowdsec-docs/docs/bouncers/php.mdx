# What is it ?

This bouncer allows to protect your php application from IPs that have been detected by crowdsec. Based on the decision that crowdsec holds, they will either get denied (403) or have to fill a captcha.

This bouncer uses the PHP `auto_preprend` mechanism and the [crowdsec php library](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/php-cs-bouncer) to offer bouncer/IPS capability directly in your php application.
The bouncer supports remediations "ban" and "captcha", and both IP/Range decisions and geoloc decisions.

# Installation

## Prerequisites

 - This is a php library, so you must have a working PHP (>= 7.2) installation.
 - Dependencies are dealt with via `composer`
 - Download the latest release of the bouncer [here](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/cs-php-bouncer/releases)
 - Have crowdsec on the same machine, or at least be able to reach LAPI

## Manual Installation

You can manually install the library and configure it with `auto_prepend_file` mechanism :
 - [library manual installation](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/php-cs-bouncer/blob/main/docs/INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md)

## Installation with helper script (apache only)

Alternatively, you can use the `install.sh` script to automate the setup on apache :

```bash
./install.sh --apache
```

The script will instruct you, after installation, to :
 - Set the owner of '/usr/local/php/crowdsec/' to www-data or similar : `sudo chown www-data /usr/local/php/crowdsec/`
 - Reload apache2 service : `sudo systemctl reload apache2`

## Upgrade with helper script

Clone the Github repository and run the upgrade script:

```bash
./upgrade.sh
```

:::note

Don't run the script as root but your password might be asked during the installation process.

:::

# Configuration

The bouncer configuration is located in `/usr/local/php/crowdsec/settings.php`.

The most relevant configuration options are the following :
 - `api_key` :
 - `api_url` : 
 - `debug_mode` : 
 - `geolocation->enabled` : 
 - `geolocation->maxmind->database_path` : path to the country mmdb file
 - `clean_ip_cache_duration`
 - `bad_ip_cache_duration`
 - `log_directory_path`

:::note

If crowdsec/cscli is installed on your machine, the installer will take care of generating API key for you.
Otherwise, be sure to set `api_key` and `api_url`.

# Testing & Troubleshooting

## Logs

Enable `debug_mode` in the library's config to enable non-error logging. Logs will be located in the library path, ie `/usr/local/php/crowdsec/.logs/`

## Testing base remediation

To test the base remediation :
 - identify or create simple php file (even a `<?php print("hello") ?>` would do)
 - add a decision on your crowdsec agent (`cscli decisions add -i <your ip>`)
 - try to access the php file, and you should see the HTML forbidden page

 ![php blocked page](/img/php-denied.png)

## Testing the captcha feature

To test the captcha remediation :
 - identify or create simple php file (even a `<?php print("hello") ?>` would do)
 - add a decision on your crowdsec agent (`cscli decisions add -i <your ip> -t captcha`)
 - try to access the php file, and you should see the captcha page

 ![php captcha page](/img/php-captcha.png)


## Testing geolocation remediation

The bouncer is expecting decisions with a scope of `Country`, and 2-letters code value.

To test the geoloc remediation :
 - identify or create simple php file (even a `<?php print("hello") ?>` would do)
 - add a decision on your crowdsec agent (`cscli decisions add --scope Country --value FR -t captcha`)
 - try to access the php file, and you should see the captcha page
